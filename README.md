# Bilkent University CS201 and CS202 Homework Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the homework assignments for the CS201 and CS202 courses at Bilkent University's Computer Science Department. Please note that these solutions are provided for reference purposes only.
You are welcome to use these solutions as a reference to help you understand the concepts and complete your own assignments. However, **do not copy or submit these solutions as your own work**. Plagiarism or any form of academic dishonesty is strongly discouraged.

## CS201 - Fundamentals of Computer Science I
This course introduces the abstract data types of lists, stacks and queues, and shows how one can implement them in C++ using fundamental data structures. It also introduces recursion and algorithm analysis.

**Spring 2022:**
1. [Homework 1: Parking Lot Management System](CS201-HW1-Spring2022-ParkingLot/)
2. [Homework 2: Complexity Analysis of Several Discrete Logarithm Algorithms](CS201-HW2-Spring2022-Complexity/)
3. [Homework 3: Puzzle Game](CS201-HW3-Spring2022-Puzzle/)
4. [Homework 4: Several Problems for Stacks](CS201-HW4-Spring2022-Questions/)

**Spring 2023:**
1. [Homework 1: Banking System](CS201-HW1-Spring2023-BankingSystem/)
2. [Homework 2: Complexity Analysis of Different Solutions for the Maximum Subsequence Sum Problem](CS201-HW2-Spring2023-AlgorithmAnalysis/)
3. [Homework 3: Student Registration System](CS201-HW3-Spring2023-RegistrationSystem/)
4. [Homework 4: Postfix Expressions](CS201-HW4-Spring2023-Postfix/)

## CS202 - Fundamentals of Computer Science II
The course picks up from where CS 201 left by discussing concepts related to algorithmic efficiency on basic abstract data types and some sorting algorithms that utilize recursion. Then, the course introduces the abstract data types of trees, tables, priority queues, and graphs, and shows how one can implement them in C++ using fundamental data structures by emphasizing run-time complexity analysis.
